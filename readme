Git repo for GODOT projects.

Blitz 2024
Test project to converting Vic-20 Blitz into a GODOT game.

Setting up a new project
========================

Godot
-----

Create a new scene 'main' and make it the default.
Create a scene called 'view'
	Add a child TextureRect node and call it 'view'.

Copy folder, and its contents, ./..../Platform into the project.
Include libraries in projects makefile.

Create a script based on a Node.
Override the void _Ready() method. This will be ran at the start.
Call into you main static Initialisation code from here and any initial loading required.

Make the script run immediately using:

    Project Settings -> Globals -> Autoload

Attach the script 'View.cs' to node 'view'.

Main.cs
This should be a godot Node, IComposition and an IBuildable.
This sould be added as an autostart, where it can invoke the build functionality.
Main should instantiate the view and create the surface for it. This will be the main screen.
The composition should expose the main view (IView) as "Platform.Main.View".


Sub projects are class libraries

    dotnet new classlib -n <NAME>


Example node use
----------------

    	Node inst = _commandScene.Instantiate();
		AddChild(inst);	
		FurnitureDisplayNode view = inst.GetNode<FurnitureDisplayNode>("Panel/Window/View");

		if(view is not IView)
		{
			throw new InvalidOperationException($"Node without IView when trying to create command '{name}'");
		}

		return view;

    Where:

        . FurnitureDisplayNode is a script based on a TextureRect and IView.
        . "Panel/Window/View" is the tree path for the physical node added to the Godot scene.

The IView will then give you access to the surface which gets created in the factory.
