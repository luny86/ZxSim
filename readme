Git repo for GODOT projects.

Blitz 2024
Test project to converting Vic-20 Blitz into a GODOT game.

Setting up a new project
========================

Godot
-----

Create a script based on a Node.
Override the void _Read() method. This will be ran at the start.
Call into you main static Initialisation code from here and any initial loading required.


Make the script run immediately using:

    Project Settings -> Globals -> Autoload


Sub projects are class libraries

    dotnet new classlib -n <NAME>


Example node use
----------------

    	Node inst = _commandScene.Instantiate();
		AddChild(inst);	
		FurnitureDisplayNode view = inst.GetNode<FurnitureDisplayNode>("Panel/Window/View");

		if(view is not IView)
		{
			throw new InvalidOperationException($"Node without IView when trying to create command '{name}'");
		}

		return view;

    Where:

        . FurnitureDisplayNode is a script based on a TextureRect and IView.
        . "Panel/Window/View" is the tree path for the physical node added to the Godot scene.

The IView will then give you access to the surface which gets created in the factory.
