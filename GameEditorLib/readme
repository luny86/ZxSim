Game Editor Library
=================
Initialise
----------
The Game Editor Librarys entry point if the main static call:

    GameEditor.Initialise()

This must be called before any other library usage.


Builder
--------
Composition
The main instance of any module is an IComposition.
A composition may implent the IBuildable interface for dependency.
A composition can have child IBuilder instances.
All compositions are owned by the main app.
Only one instance of each composite type can exist.

Buildable
The buildable is an object that implements the IBuildable interface.
By doing so the editor will recognise the class and automatically create and own an instance of the object. It will then call the IBuildable methods and
allow the instance to register its own objects or use
dependencies built by other buildables.
Any objects registered by a buildable is public to any other buildable and is injected
by the build engine.


Platform
--------
your main project, for a specific platform must define some objects that implement certain platform interfaces.

1. Composition (IComposition, IBuilder)
    Name: "GameEditor.Platform.Composition"

    Your platform needs to create a platform in the Platform namespace. This must register the following specific objects  that are platform specific but are abstracted by interfaces.

    1.a Factory (IFactory)
    This is the main goto to create platform specific objects such as surfaces.


Factory
-------
Game Editor expects a platform specific factory.
The platform (user) must register a factory that implements 
the Platform.IFactory interface.
The job of this factory is to create any object that
requires platform specific handling, such as the graphic surfaces, colours or hardware (disk loading etc). Effectively the factory if a Hardware abstraction layer.
The platform must then register the factory from within its buildable instance.
